![Consensys 2025 recap](./consensys-2025-recap.png) 
2025 was a breakout year for crypto and for Ethereum.

From regulatory shifts to digital asset treasuries and wide institutional adoption, Ethereum is reshaping global financial markets.

2026 will be even bigger as more organizations build on Ethereum.

Linea will focus on becoming a self-sustaining chain, and MetaMask will expand into more onchain assets and unlock broader real-world use.
